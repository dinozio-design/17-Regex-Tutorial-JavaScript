## Description
Developers write code, but they also *write about code*. Take a moment to search the web for tutorials about any of the subjects on Full Stack development and you’re likely to find thousands of tutorials written by developers of all skill levels, including junior developers&mdash;like yours truely!

In this week's assignment I create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. I use the template provided in the starter code to create your walkthrough.
